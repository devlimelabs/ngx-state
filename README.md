## What is this
F*#% another Angular state management framework?!?!?!?

**HELL NO!**

**@devlime/ngx-state** was created to simplify state management in Angular applications. We do not consider it a "Framework" but rather a bag of utilities to help make the world a better place by making performant state management **EASY** in Angular without the need to learn YET ANOTHER FRAMEWORK or REDUX! @devlime/ngx-state provides a **VERY SIMPLE** type-safe state class to extend from, a handful of decorators to make help make your life more enjoyable and keep states CLEAN & READABLE, and a `*subscribe` directive so you aren't `*ngIf`ing your life away

## Setup
`yarn add @devlime/ngx-state` *if you wanna be hip*

or

`npm install @devlime/ngx-state --save` *if your neck has a beard*

## Usage
Bear with us... We promise next time you check this it will be filled in

### State
The `State` service class is a base class to extend your state(s) from. It takes a type interface and provides a type-safe set function. That's it:

## Schematics
Angular schematics for @devlime/ngx-state are already underway! Update coming soon!

## Inspiration
Project inspired by Angular and how awesome it is when used properly (with great power comes great responsibility)
